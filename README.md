# td-mancala
A TD-lambda reinforcement learning algorithm for playing mancala

This acts as a research project into reinforcement learning for an independent study for RIT

## Timeline
- [X] Make the mancala functionality
- [X] Code up td(\lambda) algorithm
- [X] Configure the training to train on itself
- [-] Test results of training with human vs AI

## Requirements to Run
To be filled out later
