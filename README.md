# tp-mancala
A TP-lambda reinforcement learning algorithm for playing mancala

This acts as a research project into reinforcement learning for an independent study for RIT

## Timeline
- [] Start with coding the mancala functionality
- [] Start coding up td(\lambda) algorithm
- [] Configure the training to train on itself
- [] Test results of training with human vs AI

## Requirements to Run
To be filled out later
